                    Yelp Eliteness - Analyzing Yelp's Eliteness Critera

            </div>
            <div class="desc">
                According to Yelp, "Elite-worthiness is based on a number of things, including well-written
                reviews, high quality tips, a detailed personal profile, an active voting and complimenting record,
                and a history of playing well with others." Unfortunately, Yelp does not explicitly state eligibility
                nor requirements to be an Elite user. Users can only self-nominate and hope for the best. Given Yelp's
                user dataset, can we leverage machine learning to determine Yelp's Eliteness criteria?

                    LendingClub - Visualizing Loans And Building Investment Models

            <div class="desc">
                LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company, offering loans with fixed interest rates and equal payments. 
                Each loan is broken up into many Notes, which corresponds to a fraction of the overall loan. Investors 
                seeking higher yield fixed-income securities can build their portfolio by purchasing/investing in many Notes 
                from different loans and borrowers. Can we maximize returns by building an investment model that predicts loan 
                status, whether a loan will be fully paid or default?

                As the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm" target="_blank">SEC</a> defines, 
                "a failure to deliver occurs when a broker-dealer fails to deliver securities to the party on the other 
                side of the transaction on the settlement date." While FTDs may have profound market impacts, the intent 
                of this work is not to explain the consequences of FTDs. Let's explore the FTD data published by the SEC.
