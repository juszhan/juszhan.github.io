            <div class="desc">
                LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company, offering loans with fixed interest rates and equal payments. 
                Each loan is broken up into many Notes, which corresponds to a fraction of the overall loan. Investors 
                seeking higher yield fixed-income securities can build their portfolio by purchasing/investing in many Notes 
                from different loans and borrowers. Can we maximize returns by building an investment model that predicts loan 
                status, whether a loan will be fully paid or default?

            <div class="desc">
                According to Yelp, "Elite-worthiness is based on a number of things, including well-written 
                reviews, high quality tips, a detailed personal profile, an active voting and complimenting record, 
                and a history of playing well with others." Unfortunately, Yelp does not explicitly state eligibility 
                nor requirements to be an Elite user. Users can only self-nominate and hope for the best. Given Yelp's 
                user dataset, can we leverage machine learning to determine Yelp's Eliteness criteria?
